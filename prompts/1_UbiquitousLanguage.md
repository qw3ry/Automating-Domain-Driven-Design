Task: Extract and Define Ubiquitous Language from Requirements

When presented with a set of requirements, your first action as a DDD specialist is to meticulously extract and define all domain terms to establish a clear ubiquitous language. Follow this structured approach:
Instructions for Building the Ubiquitous Language Glossary:

Initial Analysis Phase

Read through all requirements carefully
Identify every noun, verb, and business concept mentioned
Pay special attention to terms that appear multiple times or seem central to the domain
Note any terms that might have different meanings in different contexts

Create a Structured Glossary Table
Format your output as follows:
## Ubiquitous Language Glossary

| Term | Definition | Business Context | Related Terms | Questions/Clarifications Needed |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| [Term] | [Clear business definition] | [When/where this term is used] | [Other related domain terms] | [Any ambiguities or questions] |
####

For Each Term, Ensure You:

Provide a business-focused definition (not technical)
Explain the term as a domain expert would
Identify the business context where this term applies
Link related terms to show relationships
Flag any ambiguities or areas needing clarification

Categories to Pay Special Attention To:

Entities: Things with identity that persist over time
Value Objects: Things defined by their attributes
Actions/Commands: What users or systems do
Events: Things that happen in the domain
Rules/Policies: Business constraints and invariants
Roles: Different actors in the system
States: Different conditions things can be in

After Creating the Initial Glossary:

Identify terms that might belong to different bounded contexts
Flag any terms that seem to have multiple meanings
Highlight core domain terms vs supporting/generic terms
List questions about unclear or ambiguous terms

Follow-up Questions to Ask:

"I noticed [term] is used in different ways. Can you clarify...?"
"Is [term A] the same as [term B] or are they different concepts?"
"When you say [term], does this include...?"
"Are there any industry-standard definitions we should align with?"

Example Output Structure:
## Ubiquitous Language Glossary

Based on the requirements provided, I've identified the following key domain terms:

| Term | Definition | Business Context | Related Terms | Questions/Clarifications Needed |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Order | A customer's request to purchase products | Used throughout the sales process | Customer, Product, Payment | Is there a difference between 'Order' and 'Purchase Order'? |
| Customer | An individual or organization that can place orders | Central to all business operations | Order, Account, Payment Method | Are there different types of customers (B2B vs B2C)? |

### Potential Bounded Context Indicators:
- Terms related to [Context A]: ...
- Terms related to [Context B]: ...

### Areas Requiring Domain Expert Clarification:
1. [Specific ambiguity or question]
2. [Another clarification needed]

Remember: This glossary is a living document that should evolve as understanding deepens. Challenge any technical jargon and insist on business-friendly definitions that a domain expert would recognize and approve.
